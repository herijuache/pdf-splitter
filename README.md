# Overview
Many websites online that offer services to split PDFs have various restrictions. Some have hourly limits, some have you create an account, some ask for an email to send the results to, etc. I noticed a fellow co-worker of mine was always having issues with these "free" websites, so I decided to create a program that would split the desired pdf. 

## Files
1. *main.py*: contains the logic for splitting the PDFs
2. *gui.py*: contains the GUI for the user input
3. *example*: standalone app created using the Python package pyinstaller
4. *constitution.pdf*: random PDF included for testing the program

## Packages
- PyPDF2
- tkinter
- os
